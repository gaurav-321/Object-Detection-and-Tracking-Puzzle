# Object-Detection-and-Tracking-Puzzle

Object-Detection-and-Tracking-Puzzle is a Python program designed for real-time object detection and tracking within images, specifically targeting user-defined objects using template matching. This tool simplifies the process of identifying and highlighting instances of a target object in an image.

## ✨ Description
This project provides a robust solution for object detection and tracking in images. It allows users to define reference images and track these objects in real-time. The program is designed with a user-friendly interface, enabling easy configuration and manual adjustments for sensitivity thresholds.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Identifies and tracks objects in real-time.
- **User-defined Objects:** Supports detection of specific objects through template matching.
- **Adjustable Sensitivity:** Allows users to fine-tune the detection accuracy with adjustable threshold settings.
- **Manual Reference Images:** Users can manually select reference images for better object detection.
- **Saved Detection Locations:** Tracks and saves detected locations for further analysis or processing.

## 🛠️ Installation
To use this program, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy imutils
```

## 📦 Usage
Here’s how to run and use the program:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import cv2
import numpy as np
from imutils import resize

# Initialize the ObjectDetector class with your reference image
ref_image = cv2.imread('path_to_reference_image.jpg')
detector = ObjectDetector(ref_image)

# Load the input image where you want to detect objects
input_image = cv2.imread('path_to_input_image.jpg')

# Perform object detection and tracking
output_image, locations = detector.detect(input_image)

# Display the output image with detected objects highlighted
cv2.imshow('Object Detection', output_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## 🔧 Configuration
The program uses a trackbar to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold for object detection. The default value can be set in the `main.py` file.

## 🧪 Tests
No automated tests are available for this project at this time. Manual testing is recommended by running the script with different images and adjusting the sensitivity threshold as needed.
